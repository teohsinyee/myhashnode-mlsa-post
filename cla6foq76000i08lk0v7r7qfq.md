# Why do you need to claim GitHub Student Developer Pack?
As mentioned above, you can access all the real-world tools for free by claiming this pack. Let me list out some of my favorite tools from the pack.

## StreamYard

Although we are slowly shifting from a virtual to a physical event, it is still a good idea to have a virtual event to gather people from all around the world. Therefore, you need a good streaming app to live stream your event to Youtube or even Facebook live. You can use StreamYard to achieve all of these. Normally, you need to pay **$20 USD per month** to use the basic plan. By having the GitHub Student Developer Pack, you can have the basic plan for **FREE**.

## Jetbrains IDEs

One of the best tools that the pack offered I think would be **Jetbrains IDEs** such as IntelliJ IDEA.  Jetbrains IDEs is a wonderful IDE that has many built-in features that can ease your development.  One of my favorite IDE is IntelliJ IDEA for Java. For USM students, you would use this IDE for your CAT201 Java Project. Although you can use the free version, the paid version provides more features and you can save more time to develop your app. In normal circumstances, you have to spend $59.90 USD per month to purchase the Intellij IDEA IDE paid version a.k.a IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.

By having the GitHub Student Developer Pack, you can have the Intellij IDEA Ultimate for **FREE**.   

Not other IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, you can have other choices for you to download for FREE using this pack. Above is the list of Jetbrains IDEs you can claim.
