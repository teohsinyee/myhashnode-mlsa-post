There are many note-taking apps available that are popular, such as Evernote and Notion. But if you have not tried out OneNote yet, you are missing some handy features. 

# Feature 1: Play YouTube videos directly in the application

1. First, you need to paste a YouTube video link inside OneNote. The video preview will automatically generate as below.
